# Informations about the data

The data used for training and testing the algorithm is stored in the `data/` folder. The data is organized as follows:

- `raw/`: made to contain the raw data in .npy format (use Dataloader to load the data). Ask the Dr. David Gasq for the data and copy them into `raw/Data_npy/` folder.
- `plot/`: made to contain the plots of the data.
- `static/`: made to contain the static data for illustration purposes.
